Chrome Extension that adds the Textmate URL scheme to the Rails stacktrace output.

Began as a fork of http://github.com/ryankshaw/rails-stacktrace-textmate-linker-greasemonkey-script/

Ended up rewriting from scratch and adding jQuery. Tested only with Google Chrome, should work with any Greasemonkey-enabled browser.


jQuery is downloaded from the Google CDN, so if you're offline this script won't work.

Install
-------

Open the js file with Chrome

Uninstall
---------

Through the Tools > Extensions page
